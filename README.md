1. Install NodeJS (version 10 or above)
2. `npm install`
3. To run the code, use `npm run solution`
4. To run unit tests, `npm run test`

## Requirements
For running the code, you will only need Node.js installed on your environment. 
For testing the code, you need to install Jest.

#### Node 
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
You should be able to run the following command after the installation.

#### Jest 
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is one of the popular JavaScript testing framework.

Install using `yarn`:
`yarn add --dev jest` 

Or using `npm`:
`npm install --save-dev jest`

In order to run the test file, add the following section to your `package.json`:

    {
      "scripts": {
       "test": "jest"
      }
    }
    
 ## Run 
 To run the solution by passing:
 
    npm run solution
    
 ## Test 
 To test the code:
 
    npm run test
